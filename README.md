Flask-Based Forest Fire Occurrence Prediction System Using Machine Learning

Abstract
A web-based application that predicts the likelihood of forest fire occurrence using a trained machine learning model based on oxygen level, temperature, and humidity inputs.


Problem Statement
Forest fires pose significant threats to ecological balance, wildlife, and human settlements. Manual monitoring often delays timely responses, leading to widespread damage. Thus, there is a need for an automated system that can predict fire occurrence based on environmental data to enable proactive measures for prevention and safety.


Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
•	- Develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a forest fire occurrence using environmental parameters.
•	- Deploy this model through a Flask web application to allow easy access and real-time predictions by end-users or monitoring agencies.
•	- Provide interpretable outputs that support quick decision-making for forest management authorities.


Technologies Used
•	Python for data processing and model training
•	scikit-learn for machine learning model development
•	Flask for web-based deployment
•	HTML & Jinja Templates for frontend integration
•	joblib for model serialization


Dataset Assumptions
The model assumes input features of:
1.	Oxygen Level (in % or ppm based on sensor data)
2.	Temperature (in °C)
3.	Humidity (in %)

Key Outcomes
•	Successfully trained and deployed a model to predict forest fire risk.
•	Developed a user-friendly web interface to input environmental data and view predictions.
•	Enabled practical integration of AI-based systems for environmental safety applications.


Future Scope
•	Incorporate real-time sensor data integration for automated alerts.
•	Expand the model with additional features (e.g. wind speed, forest type, rainfall).
•	Deploy on cloud platforms for scalable use by multiple forest departments.


Usage Summary
This project showcases the end-to-end pipeline of machine learning deployment, transforming a trained model into a real-time decision-support web tool for forest fire prediction, highlighting practical AI applications for environmental risk management.
